## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Legend Engine](https://legendengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://legendengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.legendengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Legend is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://legendengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Legend's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations.
